      The rain tasted of salt and regret. Detective Sarah Monroe pulled her collar higher, the damp clinging to the worn wool like a persistent ghost. Port Blossom wasn't what she’s expected. Postcards promised quaint charm, a picturesque escape from the relentless churn of city crime. What she found was grey skies, a restless ocean, and an unsettling quiet that hummed with unspoken anxieties.
      Chief Robert Dalton met her at the town limits, a man etched with years spent battling tides and secrets. His handshake was firm but his eyes held a guardedness that mirrored the weather. “Detective Monroe,” he greeted, his voice gravelly with age and a touch of weariness. "Welcome to Port Blossom. Not exactly the tourist season, I’m afraid.”
      “Thank you, Chief,” Sarah replied, her gaze sweeping over the few shops huddled along the main street. “Let's get straight to it, then. Tell me about these… messages.”
      Dalton’s face tightened further. "We've had three cases in as many weeks. Found near the victims, written on scraps of paper, smooth stones… even etched into the sand that washed away quickly. Coded messages." 
      He led her to the police station, a modest building that smelled faintly of old coffee and despair. The file on her desk was thin but chilling. Each victim – a retired fisherman, a young artist, and the town librarian – had been found alone, apparently in peaceful sleep. No signs of struggle, no obvious cause of death. Except for the cryptic messages left nearby. 
      “They’re… complex,” Sarah murmured, examining a photograph of the latest find: a series of symbols carved into a smooth grey stone found near the librarian’s cottage. "Not random scribbles, Chief. Something deliberate."
      “We consulted with the state cryptography team,” Dalton said, his voice strained. “They’re stumped. They say it’s like nothing they’ve ever seen.”
      “They haven't considered the possibility of a historical cipher,” Sarah suggested, her mind already racing. Her photographic memory was a curse and a blessing – it held everything she’d ever seen, read, or heard. She began cataloging the symbols, comparing them to ancient alphabets and forgotten codes she’s devoured in her insomniac hours. 
      “Port Blossom has a history, Detective,” Dalton continued, his eyes fixed on the stormy sea visible through the window. "A long one. Some things… are best left buried."
      The door swung open and a young man with unruly brown hair and an eager grin bounded in. “Marcus Webb, Port Blossom Gazette,” he announced, extending a hand. “I’ve been following the case closely. Any news for your humble reporter?”
      Dalton glared at him. "Marcus, this is Detective Monroe. She's here to investigate.” 
      “Pleasure to meet you, Detective,” Marcus said, his eyes sparkling with journalistic enthusiasm. “I have some theories about this, you know. I think it's connected to the Oakhaven disappearance.”
      Sarah froze. “The Oakhaven disappearance?” 
      "Thirty years ago," Marcus elaborated, sensing her interest. “A whole family vanished without a trace. Never found. The official story was a boating accident, but people… they say otherwise.”
      Dalton’s face had paled. He shot Marcus a warning look. “That's ancient history, Marcus. Don’t go stirring up old ghosts.” 
      But Sarah was already intrigued. "I'm going to need access to those files, Chief."
      Dalton hesitated then sighed. "Fine. But keep a lid on this, Monroe. Port Blossom doesn’t like its secrets unearthed.”
      Back at the rented cottage, a small seaside affair with peeling paint and a lingering smell of seaweed, Sarah spread out the files. The rain hammered against the windows, mimicking the relentless rhythm of her thoughts. She felt a familiar tightness in her chest, a knot of anxiety she’s learned to live with. 
      A sleek black cat sauntered into the room, rubbing against her legs. “So,” the cat said, his voice a low rumble that seemed to vibrate through the floorboards. “Not thrilled with Port Blossom, I presume?”
      Sarah didn’t even blink. Years ago, she's accepted the oddity that was her cat, Fart. “You talk,” she stated matter-of-factly, already turning her attention back to the files. “It's convenient.”
      “Indeed,” Fart purred, leaping onto a chair and observing her with intelligent green eyes. “And you appear to be preoccupied.”
      Sarah ignored him, focusing on the faded newspaper clippings about the Oakhaven family. Something felt…familiar. A flicker of recognition danced at the edge of her memory, a half-forgotten dream she couldn's quite grasp. 
      Marcus Webb called later that evening, persistent as the tide. “Detective Monroe, I have something you need to see. A map – an old one, dating back to the 1800s. It shows a series of tunnels beneath Port Blossom.”
      He’s waiting for her at the Gazette office, a cramped space filled with stacks of paper and the scent of ink. He handed her the map, yellowed and brittle with age. It depicted a network of underground passages, labeled in an elegant script that seemed to hum with forgotten secrets.
      As she studied the map, a wave of dizziness washed over her. She felt as though she's stumbled into something vast and ancient, a conspiracy woven into the very fabric of Port Blossom. And she knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that the cryptic messages were not random. They were keys – unlocking a door to a past she wasn't sure she was ready to face.
      The rain outside intensified, the wind howling a mournful lament that echoed the unsettling whispers of Port Blossom. Sarah looked up at Marcus, her gaze sharp and unwavering. “This is just the beginning,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. “And I have a feeling it’s going to be very complicated.”

      The rain tasted of salt and regret. Detective Sarah Monroe pulled her coat tighter, the damp chill seeping into her bones despite the thick wool. Port Blossom wasn’t a town you *visited*; it was a place people got stuck in, like driftwood snagged on hidden reefs. And right now, it felt distinctly unsettling.
      The small police station smelled of damp wood and decades-old coffee. Chief Robert Dalton, a man whose face was carved from granite and worry, greeted her with a curt nod. His eyes, the color of faded denim, held an unspoken plea.
      “Detective Monroe,” he rumbled, his voice gravelly from years of shouting over the crashing waves and dwindling budgets. “Glad you’ve arrived. Things…well, things are peculiar.”
      “Peculiar how, Chief?” Sarah asked, her voice steady despite the tightness in her chest. Insomnia was a constant companion; she’s used to an undercurrent of unease, a low hum beneath her skin. This felt different.
      “Three people found in the last month,” Dalton explained, gesturing to a corkboard plastered with photos. Each picture showed a person found near the shoreline, seemingly asleep or lost in thought. But it was what *accompanied* them that made Sarah’s stomach clench.
      Beside each body, scrawled in elegant calligraphy on a smooth piece of driftwood or embedded within the sand, was a sequence of symbols. Not random graffiti; these were codes, intricate and deliberate.
      “They call it the Midnight Cipher,” Dalton continued, his face grimacing. “Local papers are having a field day with it.”
      Sarah’s gaze swept over the board, her photographic memory already cataloging every detail of each symbol. She felt a familiar surge – that electric hum that meant her brain was firing on all cylinders, analyzing, dissecting. "Have you had any luck deciphering them?"
      Dalton shook his head, a weary sigh escaping him. "Our best minds have been stumped. It’s…old-fashioned, somehow. Like something out of a history book.”
      “I'm on it, Chief," Sarah stated firmly. She needed to feel the weight of a case in her hands – any case—to quiet the ghosts that rattled around inside her.
      Marcus Webb, a young reporter with perpetually rumpled hair and an eager grin, practically bounced into the station. He was all energy, a stark contrast to Dalton’s stoicism. “Detective Monroe! So you've arrived! Marcus Webb, Port Blossom Gazette. Wonderful to meet you.” He extended a hand, his grip surprisingly firm. 
      “Detective Monroe,” she acknowledged, her gaze assessing him. He was observant, too much so for a small-town reporter. “Mr. Webb.”
      “I’ve been following this case closely,” he said, his eyes bright with ambition. “It's quite the story, don’t you think? The town is buzzing.”
      “I’m here to solve the case, not discuss its popularity,” Sarah replied, her voice clipped. 
      “Of course, of course," Marcus chuckled nervously. "Just thought you might appreciate the local perspective.” 
      Later that evening, back at the rented cottage overlooking the turbulent sea, Sarah spread out a map of Port Blossom. The symbols from each cipher were meticulously copied onto it. She felt an inexplicable pull, a sense of recognition she couldn't explain. 
      A sleek black cat materialized from the shadows, weaving between her legs and rubbing against her ankles. “Quite a mess you've gotten yourself into, haven’t you?” the cat purred. His voice was deep and melodious, a startling contrast to his feline form. 
      Sarah didn’t even flinch. She was used to the unexpected. "You can talk?" she asked, stating a fact, not posing a question.
      The cat, who she’s named Fart (much to her own quiet amusement), flicked his tail dismissively. “Naturally. It’s quite rude to stare, you know.” He hopped onto the table, his emerald eyes fixed on the map. “Those symbols…they’re old. Very old.”
      "You recognize them?" Sarah inquired, ignoring Fart's apparent disdain for manners. 
      “They echo a forgotten tale,” Fart murmured, gazing intently at one of the symbols. "A story lost to time."
      The next morning, Sarah found herself back at the police station, pouring over old records with Dalton. As she sifted through yellowed newspaper clippings and faded police reports, a name surfaced repeatedly: Elias Thorne. Thirty years ago, Thorne, a renowned historian and collector of antique ciphers, disappeared without a trace. A string of similar coded messages had been found around Port Blossom just prior to his vanishing. The case was officially closed, deemed a "tragic accident," but whispers of something more sinister persisted.
      Dalton’s face paled as she brought up Thorne's name. "Elias… that was a difficult time," he mumbled, avoiding her gaze. 
      "Why do you look so uncomfortable, Chief?" Sarah pressed gently.
      He cleared his throat, the color returning to his face slowly. “I was a rookie back then. We… we didn’t know what to make of it.” 
      “And you never reopened the case?” Sarah asked, her eyes narrowed. “Even with these new messages mirroring those from thirty years ago?”
      Dalton’s silence was an answer in itself. As Sarah left the station, she felt a cold certainty grip her. Port Blossom's quiet facade hid a dark secret, and the Midnight Cipher was just the beginning. 
      Later that evening, back at her cottage, Fart sat perched on a windowsill, watching the storm clouds gather. "The cat actually is a prince of darkness.” he stated matter-of-factly, as if simply stating the weather. "You'd best get used to it."

The killer’s identity is shocking: it's Chief Dalton’s estranged son, Thomas, who was a young boy when his father investigated the Mariner's Riddle. He believes his father failed to find justice, and he is determined to finish what his father started.
